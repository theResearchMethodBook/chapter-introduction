## Why this book ? {#intro}

There are plenty of good books on research methods for different disciplines, so why another one?


One starting point was the development of a MOOC on multi-disciplinary research methods for engineers in 2020. With this MOOC we tried to give a simplified introduction to research methods on which participants could build. The MOOC targeted to give participants a good understanding of where to start and what are the decisions you have to make in a research project on human-computer systems in general. Nevertheless when looking for reference materials on which learners could build we did not find open content chapters to give a simple but comprehensive overview on many methods and research instruments. The aim of this book is to fill this gap and become and online repository with simple introductions to important decisions in a research project and primers for research methods in the different phases of the research project.

A second issue was the long ongoing discussion of the TEL community on how to develop a flexible approach and strategy for doing Technology Enhanced Learning Research coming from different starting points and disciplinary backgrounds.

    random_array = [[random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
    return random_array

def plot_array_lines(array):
    rows = len(array)
    cols = len(array[0])
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))

    for i in range(rows):
        plt.plot(range(1, cols+1), array[i], label=f'Row {i+1}')

    plt.xlabel('Column')
    plt.ylabel('Value')
    plt.title('Line Chart of Array Rows')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()

rows = 4
cols = 4
random_array = generate_random_array(rows, cols)
plot_array_lines(random_array)

## Research methods for whom?

This book is for students of every age and background which enjoy learning about these topics. One scenario is bachelor and master students which have to do a research project in there studies. Some of the foundations chapters should give them a primer for the structure and decisions to make to come to a study design. On the other hand this is also for multi year research settings as in a PhD project or other projects.

The focus of this book is on research methods that are used to understand human-computer systems mostly in the field of learning and teaching with technology. Of course the methods are helpful, useful and can be applied in other domains but this is the main focus.
